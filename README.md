Handwritten Digit Prediction - Classification Analysis
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Handwritten Digit Prediction project, completed as part of the Data Science and Machine Learning Internship at Ybi Foundation.

Project Overview
The objective of this project was to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts handwritten digits (0-9) using the sci-kit-learn's built-in "digits" dataset. The dataset consists of images of handwritten digits, where each image is an 8x8 pixel matrix. The project involved data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

Installation
To run the code and reproduce the results, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3. x
sci-kit-learn
NumPy
pandas
matplotlib
You can install the required packages using pip:

pip install sci-kit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

handwritten_digit_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
images/: Directory containing images used in the README.
Data
The dataset used for this project is the "digits" dataset from sci-kit-learn's built-in datasets. It consists of 1797 images of handwritten digits, each represented by an 8x8 pixel matrix. The target variable represents the actual digit value (0-9).

Usage
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-digit-prediction.git

Open the Jupyter Notebook handwritten_digit_prediction.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code step-by-step.

Results
After running the notebook, you will see the accuracy of the trained model and performance metrics such as the confusion matrix and classification report. Additionally, you can use the trained model to make predictions for new handwritten digits.

Conclusion
The Handwritten Digit Prediction project showcases the power of classification models in identifying handwritten digits with high accuracy. Through this internship at Ybi Foundation, I gained valuable experience in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, which will undoubtedly contribute to my journey in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning.
